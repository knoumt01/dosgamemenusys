# dosgamemenusys

This is a simple menu written in C/C++ that utilizes basic concepts in 
programming, including flow control, standard I/O, functions and 
variable declaration & initialization. The purpose of this menu is to make it 
easy for my wife to play DOS games from her MacBook utilizing FreeDOS 
running under VirtualBox. This file will be loaded at the end of the 
autoexec.bat file, so that the menu will load after boot without having 
to locate the .exe and run it.

Feel free to modify and improve this menu system. If you are a beginner, 
some possible projects are:
1. Instead of having the path of applications within the application 
itself, have the data read from an external data file.
2. Use an operation other than system() to load the external game 
executables.
3. Create a GUI that is compatible with FreeDOS that would allow 
point-and-click access to the games.
4. Add an administrative portion to the program that is password 
protected that allows modification of the menu options, including adding 
/ removing games from the list, modifying the executable paths, etc.
